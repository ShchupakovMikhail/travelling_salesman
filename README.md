A problem:
N towns are given on the map. Suggest an algorithm that will allow you to find the optimal route to bypass all N cities and return to the starting point.

Two algorithms implemented:
1) The first algorithm generates all possible permutations, which represents possible routes.
2) The second builds a decision tree
3) An algorithms called "efficientCalcTree" is a more efficient decision tree based method
